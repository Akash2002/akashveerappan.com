Welcome to my website! As an avid software developer and a design hobbyist, I emphasize simplicity and minimalism to give the users just what they want and no
more to reduce complexity and bolster ease of access and usability. <br>
###### Fun fact: my most favorite color to use is burgundy. It seems to go well everywhere!
